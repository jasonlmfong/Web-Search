# Web-Search

This repository contains my `C++` implementation of web search algorithms, such as PageRank and HITS(hyperlink-induced topic search).

These algorithms were famously created by Sergey Brin, and Larry Page, and Jon Kleinberg, for [Google](www.google.com) and [Ask](www.ask.com), respectively.
